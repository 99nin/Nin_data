# Data Mining Project
The aim of the project is to build a regression model that can predict house prices in the city of Bangalore

Following are the steps followed in my analysis

## Data Cleaning : 

Removing null values
Handling duplicates
Ensuring the consistency of the data types

## Dimensionality reduction:

It reduces the noise within the data by removing the correlated variables. This improves the model accuracy. 

## Model creation:

I have used scikit learn to build and test the regression model and used crossvalidation to avoid overfitting of the model
